\chapter{Structure of a thesis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
This chapter provides a template of the thesis structure. Further details should be discussed with your supervisors.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
%%%
This section should give a short overview about the actual problems in the environment (problem field) of your thesis.

It should also be added why your work is important in the field.

Afterwards, there should be a short text passage which describes what you are exactly doing in your thesis. Then you write down the structure of your thesis.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Background}
%%%
In this chapter, you write the necessary background to understand all topics of your thesis. It should fulfill 25-40\% (bachelor), 20-30\% (master) or 15-25\% (PhD) of the whole thesis. This can also include a short overview of the state-of-the-art.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Concept}
%%%
In this chapter, you write about the concept about you implemented in hardware and/or software. The description should be on a high-level before you go into detail with the implementation.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Implementation}
%%%
In this chapter, you write about the implementation in detail. Here, you can also describe the results from testing the implementation in software and hardware. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Evaluation}
%%%
In this chapter, you evaluate your concept and implementation in the environment in order to solving the problem. How much better is your implementation compared to previous works or other implementation from state-of-the-art.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusion}
%%%
In this chapter, you summarize your work in which you describe your implementation with the results from the evaluation. Also, you give an outlook of future work and mention the open problems.
